Bindings to the mpdecimal library by Stefan Krah, which is available at

http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal

mpdecimal provides decimal floating point arithmetic.  It currently is
the basis for the decimal library in the Python standard library.
More information on decimal arithmetic is at

These bindings were written for mpdecimal version 2.4.0.  You will
need to install mpdecimal before you install this library.

These bindings were made using bindings-dsl:
